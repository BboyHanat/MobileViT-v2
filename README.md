# MobileViT v2 

## Unofficial PyTorch implementation of MobileViT v2. Most code is borrowed from official implement [ml-cvnets](https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets) 

This project mean to make a friendly code for downstream task, like object detection, segmentation. etc. It's easy for integration. I had uploaded some converted model to BaiDuNetDisk for fine-tuning (convert from official pretrained model).  I also compared inference result with original model and no suspicious result.


### Model convert code in code tail of 'mobilevit_v2.py', also can directly download those model from BaiDuNetDisk
